### Dice Rolls

I've created this project inspired by [this post](http://www.redblobgames.com/articles/probability/damage-rolls.html).
My project lets you use any type of dice and then "cheat" with it.
I imagine this could be useful if we want to increase the game difficulty by creating an AI that has better rolls on the same type of spell/weapon/etc.
