# toys-n-tools
This repository contains tools and toys I've created in order to simplify some things or as a proof of concept. It's a mix of everything and the goal has always been to keep the code as simple as it could be, which means the files are rarely long. I try to keep the comments to the minimum as the code is self-explanatory most of the time, but always include them when needed.
